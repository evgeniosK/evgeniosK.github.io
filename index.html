      <p>I am Evgenios (pronounced <a href="https://forvo.com/word/%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82/" target="_blank">ev-YEN-ee-os</a>) and in Fall'21 I will be an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at George Mason University.     
      My research is in <b>computer security</b> and <b>applied cryptography</b> and focuses on analyzing and designing efficient encrypted systems using techniques from cryptography and algorithms. 
      I am the head of the <a href="https://encrypted.systems" target="_blank">Encrypted Systems Group</a> at George Mason.</p>
            
      <p>Before Mason, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the EECS Department at UC Berkeley working with <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/song.html" target="_blank">Dawn Song</a> from 2019-2021. 
      I obtained my PhD in 2019 from the Computer Science Department at Brown University working under the supervision of <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/rtamassi/" target="_blank">Roberto Tamassia</a>. 
      My doctoral dissertation received the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/about/newsletter/joukowsky-awards-recognize-four-outstanding-dissertations" target="_blank">Joukowsky Outstanding Dissertation Award</a> from the Graduate School of Brown University.</p>
