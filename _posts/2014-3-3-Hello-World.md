My name is Evgenios (pronounced ev-YEN-ee-os), I am an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science department at George Mason University. Before Mason, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the EECS Department at UC Berkeley working under the mentorship of Dawn Song. I obtained my PhD from the Computer Science Department at Brown University with Roberto Tamassia.

My research is in computer security and focuses on analyzing and designing efficient encrypted systems using techniques from cryptography and algorithms. Other recent ongoing projects include secure computation and adversarial inputs for machine learning algorithms. In the past I have worked on various problems with strong algorithmic component. .
